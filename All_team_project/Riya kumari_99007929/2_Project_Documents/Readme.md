## Introduction
The objective is to design an efficient automatic authorized vehicle identification system by using the vehicle number plate. The system is implemented on the entrance for security control of a highly restricted area like military zones or area around top government offices
e.g. Parliament, Supreme Court etc. The developed system first detects the vehicle and then captures the vehicle image. Vehicle number plate region is extracted using the image segmentation in an image. Optical character recognition technique is used for the character recognition.
The resulting data is then used to compare with the records on a database so as to come up with the specific information like the vehicle’s owner, place of registration, address, etc. The system is implemented and simulated in MATLAB, and it performance is tested on real image. 
It is observed from the experiment that the developed system successfully detects and recognize the vehicle number plate on real images.
## Features


# SWOT Analysis
## Strength
- It helps to detect the vehicle easily which voilate the traffic rules
- It reduces the man power
- Still and Video Footage -
  Not every automatic number plate recognition system has both still and video footage but many do. Some systems are specially designed to take snapshots when a vehicle speeds or jumps a red light, takes a wrong turn or just goes haywire on the road.
  The stills and video footage can help law enforcement agencies, traffic departments and can also assist legal counsels.
- Proactive and Reactive Security - 
Automatic number plate recognition is a deterrent. Those who are serial traffic offenders would resist from breaking the law. The systems also help with reactive security, including inspections and forensics, investigations and legal proceedings.
Whichever perspective you look at it from, automatic number plate recognition seems a necessity and a boon.

## Weakness 
- Some plates cannot be detected due to speeding of vehicle.
- Privacy Concerns - The fact that images and records are kept and stored for a long time raises privacy concerns. The records of a person’s whereabouts in all the footages can be misused. Stalkers, data thefts and people with 
various nefarious intentions can misuse all such data.
- Lack of Manned Surveillance - 
The availability of an automatic system has reduced the importance of manned surveillance. Not only is there less traffic personnel on the streets and major crossroads but those that are there don’t bother to check number plates. 
This may lead to lapse in manned security.
- Bad Weather or Hindrances -
Coupled with the lack of manned surveillance, bad weather or any kind of hindrances and obstructions can make automatic number plate recognition systems ineffective. In such cases, the security measures may go kaput.

## Opportunities
- Automative application
-  This system can be use for parking management if the vehicle is placed at no parking area then it can detect the number plate to send the warning to the ownwer.
## Threats
- There should be camera with high resolution.
- Due to compatitors ,the product can supressed.
